# sfnc
sfnc will be an alien/NPC creator for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, using the rules and guidelines found in the _Alien Archive_.

## Installation
Hopefully, the only installation that will be needed is to download the Java file.

## Usage
Hopefully, you'll be able to use the program by double-clicking the Java file.

## Known Issues
Since there isn't actually a program yet, there are no known issues!

## Contributing
Since it's just starting up, I want to have only myself doing the contributing.
Eventually, I will want help with data entry at the very least.

## License
This will have some sort of license.
I will also probably have to provide some sort of OGL and/or Starfinder license, but I'm not a lawyer and can't afford one, so I'll probably do it wrong.
