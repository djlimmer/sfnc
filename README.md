# sfnc
sfnc is an alien/NPC creator for the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, using the rules and guidelines found in the _Alien Archive_.

## Installation
The only installation that will be needed is to download the Java file and the various \*.txt files, and put them in the same directory.

## Usage
You can use the program by double-clicking the Java file.

## Known Issues
No known issues, but there are certainly features that need to be added.

## Contributing
Let me know if you want to contribute, and how; I'm sure we can work something out.

## License
This will have some sort of license.  For now, you can use it and modify it freely, as long as you don't claim it as your own.
I will also probably have to provide some sort of OGL and/or Starfinder license, but I'm not a lawyer and can't afford one, so I'll probably do it wrong.
